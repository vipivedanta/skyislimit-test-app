#Pending items

1. Saving todo items ( can be done with restful controllers)
2. Listing infinite scrolling ( idea - load next list on scroll end )
3. Heroku deployment
4. I used mysql in local, Heroku mysql plugins requires some time to setup ( including credit card information I think)
5. User validation - can be done with RegisterController@validator
6. Profile page

#what could have been improved

1. Over all design
2. Logout should be a form submit as per Laravel conventions
